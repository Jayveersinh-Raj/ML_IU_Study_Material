You can plot the `learning curve` by recording the `model.fit` in a variable, and plotting it against epochs. Iterations and epochs are terms that could be used
interchangeably.

`Epsilon` (&epsilon;) is used for automatic convergence testing. If the value of loss reaches there, we declare convergence. However, it is very difficult to decide
such epsilon, same as it is difficult to decide the number of iterations it would need.
